# Username Color Feature Demo

The bitchat Android app already has the username color feature fully implemented! Here's how it works:

## How It Works

1. **Your username remains green** - Uses `colorScheme.primary` (bright green in dark mode, dark green in light mode)
2. **Other users get unique colors** - Based on their peer ID using the `getUsernameColor()` function
3. **Colors are consistent** - Same user always gets the same color across sessions
4. **Terminal-friendly palette** - 16 colors that work on both black and white backgrounds

## Color Palette

The system uses these 16 terminal-friendly colors for other users:

- 🟢 Bright Green (#00FF00)
- 🔵 Cyan (#00FFFF)  
- 🟡 Yellow (#FFFF00)
- 🔴 Magenta (#FF00FF)
- 🟦 Bright Blue (#0080FF)
- 🟠 Orange (#FF8000)
- 🔶 Lime Green (#80FF00)
- 🟣 Purple (#8000FF)
- 🩷 Pink (#FF0080)
- 💚 Spring Green (#00FF80)
- 🟦 Light Cyan (#80FFFF)
- 🩷 Light Red (#FF8080)
- 🟦 Light Blue (#8080FF)
- 🟡 Light Yellow (#FFFF80)
- 🩷 Light Magenta (#FF80FF)
- 🟢 Light Green (#80FF80)

## Example Chat Display

```
[14:23:45] <@you> hello everyone!                    ← Your message (green)
[14:23:47] <@alice> hey there!                       ← Alice (cyan)
[14:23:50] <@bob> how's it going?                    ← Bob (yellow)
[14:23:52] <@charlie> great to see you all          ← Charlie (magenta)
[14:23:55] <@you> having a great time                ← Your message (green)
[14:23:58] <@alice> same here @you!                  ← Alice (cyan again)
```

## Code Implementation

The feature is implemented in `/app/src/main/java/com/bitchat/android/ui/ChatScreen.kt`:

- Line 342-350: Color assignment logic in `formatMessageAsAnnotatedString()`
- Line 820-855: `getUsernameColor()` function that generates consistent colors
- Uses peer ID for consistency (falls back to nickname if no peer ID available)
- Integrates perfectly with the existing IRC-style chat format

## Testing

The feature is already working in the app. When you chat with multiple users, you'll see:
- Your messages in green
- Each other user in their own unique color
- Same user always has the same color
- Colors remain consistent across app restarts
- Works in both light and dark themes

The feature is **complete and ready to use**! 🎉
